by casting to an integer we insure there is no SQL injection.  this doesn't however see if you have access to said item.

$id = (int) $request['id'];
$result = query($conn, "SELECT * FROM testdb WHERE id = $id");

2. 

a = 4 
b = 3

you pass by reference, set return to the value of a, then increase the value of a (by reference).  return is still the old value (not reference).

3. 

Object PraseCode use as ParseCode::parseToString("filepath")
